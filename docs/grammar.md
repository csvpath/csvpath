# CsvPath Grammar

The CsvPath grammar is a work in progress. You can see the current versions in Scanner and LarkParser.

Due to development choices over time, matching is handled by Lark and scanning by Ply. That division of labor is likely to change in the near future. Scanning and matching will probably each continue to be handled by its own parser.
