# Scanning

The scanning part of a csvpath enumerates selected lines. For each line returned, the line number, the scanned line count, and the match count are available. The set of line numbers scanned is also available.

The scan part of the path starts with a dollar sign to indicate the root, meaning the file from the top. After the dollar sign comes the file path. The scanning instructions are in a bracket. The rules are:
- `[*]` means all
- `[3*]` means starting from line 3 and going to the end of the file
- `[3]` by itself means just line 3
- `[1-3]` means lines 1 through 3
- `[1+3]` means lines 1 and line 3
- `[1+3-8]` means line 1 and lines 3 through eight
