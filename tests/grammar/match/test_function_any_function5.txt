                ~ 81 is returning its value, not its match, because it's being
                  assigned. it isn't participating because onmatch fails so
                  its value is None, rather than its default match which is
                  True, as for all components. so None is the right answer ~
                @found = any.onmatch.81(headers())
                @found2 = any.82(headers())
                ~ 83 is similar to 81; however, we are getting the match
                  not the value because we're not being assigned. that means True.
                  when not(True) False. the trick is realizing that not() is being
                  assigned, but the contents of not() are being matched.
                  assignment is not transitive.

                @notfound = not(any.onmatch.83(headers()))
