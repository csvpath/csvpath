                ~ this is a tricky case! it is duplicated (at least today) in
                test_header.py. there are more detailed notes there on why the
                results are what they are ~
                @found = any.onmatch(headers())
                @found2 = any(headers())
                @notfound = not(any.onmatch(headers()))
                no()
            ]
